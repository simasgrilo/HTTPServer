# HTTPServer
Simple HTTP server to serve static resources as suggested in John Cricket's [coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-webserver). It supports multi-threading to handle multiple clients at a time, and also supports the configuration of directories where the resources to be served are found.

It uses only Java standard libraries, so no other external dependency is required.
